# Lucky Tickets Calculator

This project implements a Python program to count the number of lucky tickets using both multithreading and multiprocessing techniques. A lucky ticket is defined as a ticket where the sum of the digits in the first half is equal to the sum of the digits in the second half.

## Features

- Computes the number of lucky tickets for a specified number of digits.
- Uses multithreading to perform computations concurrently.
- Uses multiprocessing to leverage multiple CPU cores for faster computation.
- Provides timing for each approach to compare performance.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dperepadya/multithreading.git
